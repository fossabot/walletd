//! # WalletD Bitcoin Library
//!
//! This library provides a wallet implementation for Bitcoin including the ability create a new wallet or import an existing wallet, check balances, and handle transactions.
//! It supports a heirarchical deterministic (HD) wallet structure and provides the ability to search for previously used addresses associated with the wallet as well as the creation of new addresses.
//! It also facilitates obtaining blockchain information.
